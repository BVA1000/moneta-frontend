        <h2>About Moneta</h2>
        <p>
          The word Moneta stands for “Coin” in several languages like Italian
          and Russian. Moneta was created by Ben Von Achen, who from childhood
          took interest in Numismatics, which is the study of coins and
          currency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ben worked in the industry buying and selling precious metals and
          collectible coins and currency. It was through his past experience
          where he was inspired to create this exclusive platform for coin
          enthusiasts, who take interest in numismatics.
