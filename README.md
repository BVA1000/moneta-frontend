# moneta-frontend
The Frontend application for Moneta®

Moneta® is a platform for coin collectors, enthusiasts, and numsmatists. 
Our users are able to create and post blogs related to the topics of Numismatics, Monetary History, and current Coin News.
With this revolutionary platform, our users will be able to share valuable information with other users
as well as being able to buy, sell, or display their coin and currency collections.

"Moneta" stands for "Coin" in several languages such as Russian and Italian. Our founder, Ben Von Achen, was inspired by the idea for Moneta® for his love
for the hobby. From a very young age, Ben was intrigued by the Study of Numismatics and Monetary History. 
He loves and appreciates the art of coins and currency. He also worked for several coin dealers, buying and selling 
precious metals and rare coins and currency.

The Study of Numismatics in a sense has become a lost art, which is why we need to bring it to light in the great digital era.
At Moneta® we want to make Numismatics Great Again by bringing it into the digital frontier.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
